#  cmdease ‚Äì Developer Command Palette CLI

`cmdease` is an advanced, interactive **Command Palette CLI** built to supercharge your development workflow.
It brings the power of centralized, categorized, and searchable commands right into your terminal, reducing the need to remember or search for commands across multiple project files, scripts, or documentation.

---

## ‚ú® Why cmdease?

Developers often waste precious minutes:

* Repeating commonly used terminal commands.
* Searching complex project-specific CLI commands.
* Manually syncing or organizing frequently used commands.

**`cmdease` solves this.**
It acts like a command launcher in your terminal ‚Äî just like VS Code's Command Palette, but for your CLI.

###  Key Benefits:

*  **Boosts Productivity:** Run categorized project commands instantly.
*  **Auto-Sync:** Always get the latest commands synced from GitHub.
*  **Offline Support:** Full local cache for seamless offline usage.
*  **Favorites:** Mark and quickly access frequently used commands.
*  **History Tracking:** Easily find and re-run previously used commands.
*  **Network Awareness:** Smartly syncs when the connection is restored.
*  **Project Scoped:** Customizable per project with a simple `cmdpalette.json` file.
